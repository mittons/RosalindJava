recursive algorithm for genrating permutations of a list by switching the elements
each level i of recursion swaps the element at index i with each of the elements with indexes greater than i and then at the next level of recursion (and every level there after) elements at indexes 0 to i will not be moved
the following is a visualization of the algorithm,
    elements without an exclamation mark can still be swapped
    elements with an exclamation mark are in their final position in that level of recursion and in every recursive call originating for that level/recursive call.
    note this only shows 1/4th of the full run for four elements (the cases where 1, 2 or 3 are in the first position are skipped)

0	1	2	3
	0!	1	2	3
		0!	1!	2	3
			0!	1!	2!	3
			0!	1!	3!	2
		0!	2!	1	3
			0!	2!	1!	3
			0!	2!	3!	1
		0!	3!	2	1
			0!	3!	2!	1
			0!	3!	1!	2
