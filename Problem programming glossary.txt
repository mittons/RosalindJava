SUBS
	Substring search - Finding locations where substring t occurs within a string s.
		Solution algorith: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm. (and possibly other algorithms)

GRPH
	Overlap graph - Given a postive integer k and a collection of strings, the overlap graph given k, O_{k}, for the collection of strings is a 
		directed graph where each string represents a node and an directed edge from string "s" to string "t" means that the k suffix of "s" matches the k prefix of "t".

LCSM
	Common substring - Given a list of strings, a "common substring" is a substring of every string in the list.
	Longest common substring - Given a list of strings, the "longest common substring" is the longest "common substring" of the list.
	
PMCH
	Matching in a graph G - Collection of edges of G where no node belongs to more than one edge in the collection
	Perfect matching in a graph G - If G contains a even number of nodes, i.e. 2n nodes, then a matching in G is perfect if it contains n edges (e.g. every nodes in G belong to an edge in the matching)
	Complete graph - Graph where each node is connected to every other node with an edge.
	Bonding graph of an RNA string - Each symbol(base) in the string is represented by a node.
		The nodes of adjacent symbols in the strings are connected by an edge called "adjacency edge".
		Then, we add an edge, called "basepair edge", between every every pair of nodes where the nodes have complementary bases (i.e. one has base A and the other U, or one has C and the other G)
